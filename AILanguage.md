# Synthese: A Conceptual Language for Human-AI Communication

This document outlines **Synthese**, a newly invented language designed to be unambiguous and structured for effective Human-AI dialogue. It aims to reduce confusion, minimize ambiguity, and enhance machine parsing capabilities.

## 1. Design Goals

### Clarity & Precision
- Each sentence has a **clear**, **rigid structure** for consistent parsing by AI.  
- Ambiguities and idioms are minimized to avoid misinterpretation.

### Ease of Learning for Humans
- **Simple phonetics** with minimal irregularities.  
- **Straightforward grammar** that avoids complicated inflections or exceptions.

### Contextual Metadata
- Built-in markers to convey speaker intent, certainty levels, or references to external data.

### Machine-Readable Format
- **Consistent word order** and tagging for easy parsing.  
- Support for “meta-statements” that specify how the content should be interpreted (e.g., a request vs. an assertion).

## 2. Phonology & Orthography

- **Alphabet:** 16 letters (8 consonants, 5 vowels, 3 semivowels) + 2 special symbols for tagging.  
  - **Consonants (C):** p, t, k, f, s, m, n, r  
  - **Vowels (V):** a, e, i, o, u  
  - **Semivowels (SV):** y, w, h (used in specific marker contexts)  
  - **Tagging Symbols:**
    - `@` for referencing external data or ID tags  
    - `#` for specifying confidence levels or emotional tone  

- **Pronunciation:** Each letter has **one consistent sound**:
  - a = /a/ (“father”)  
  - e = /e/ (“bed”)  
  - i = /i/ (“machine”)  
  - o = /o/ (“more”)  
  - u = /u/ (“flute”)

- **Example word shapes:**  
  - tera (simple CV–CV)  
  - samofe (CVCVCV)

## 3. Basic Parts of Speech

1. **Nouns (N)**: Refer to entities (people, objects, concepts).  
2. **Verbs (V)**: Actions or states.  
3. **Descriptors (D)**: Adjectives and adverbs merged into a single category that modifies nouns or verbs.  
4. **Particles (P)**: Small words that convey grammatical relationships—similar to prepositions or conjunctions.  
5. **Markers (M)**: Special function words or symbols that clarify tense, aspect, polarity, speech act type, etc.

---

## 4. Sentence Structure (S–V–O)

- **Default Order:** Subject – Verb – Object  
- **Optional Modifiers:** Descriptors can precede or follow nouns/verbs but must be marked.  
- **Particles:** Typically come before the phrase they modify.

**Example Structure:**  
[MARKER(Speech Act)] + Subject + Marker(Tense) + Verb + Object + (Optional Descriptors/Particles)

---

## 5. Tense & Aspect Markers

- **Present:** ya  
- **Past:** ha  
- **Future:** ma  
- **Continuous Aspect:** ru (can be combined with a tense marker, e.g., ha-ru for past continuous)

These markers appear immediately **before** the verb.

**Example:**  
    S ya-run to  
    = "I (am) running now."

---

## 6. Intent & Certainty Markers

- **Speech Act Markers:**  
  - di (Declarative/Statement)  
  - qi (Interrogative/Question)  
  - ci (Imperative/Command)

- **Certainty Markers:**  
  - #1 (High certainty)  
  - #0 (Low certainty)

These appear at the start of a sentence or just after the speech-act marker to signal the speaker’s stance.

**Examples:**  
    di#1 S ya-know data  
    = "I am certain I know the data."

    qi#0 You ma-understand concept?  
    = "Do you (uncertainly) understand the concept in the future?"

---

## 7. Referencing External Data

Use `@` plus a label or ID to reference external data (e.g., @doc001, @imgX).

**Example:**  
    di S ha-read report @doc001  
    = "I read the report (document #doc001)."

---

## 8. Modifier Placement

Descriptors (adjectives/adverbs) are always marked with a small particle `le` before they modify nouns or verbs:

    S ya-run le-quick
    = "I run quickly."

    S see le-blue object
    = "I see a blue object."

---

## 9. Polarity & Negation

Negation is handled by a simple prefix `no-` before the verb or descriptor:

    di S ya-no-know response
    = "I do not know the response."

---

## 10. Sample Sentences

1. **Simple Declarative**  
       di S ya-eat food  
       = "I am eating food."

2. **Question with Future Tense**  
       qi You ma-arrive place@loc123?  
       = "Will you arrive at location #loc123?"

3. **Command + Descriptor**  
       ci You ya-read le-important doc @doc777  
       = "Read the important doc #doc777."

4. **Combination of Certainty Marker & Negation**  
       di#0 S ha-no-find error  
       = "I am uncertain, but I did not find an error (in the past)."

---

## 11. AI-Specific Usage

- **Parsing:**  
  The AI reads the speech-act marker (di, qi, or ci), the certainty marker (#1 or #0), the tense marker (ya, ha, or ma), and the structure (Subject, Verb, Object).
- **References (@):**  
  Allows the AI to pull relevant data from external databases or documents directly.
- **Rigid Grammar:**  
  Tags and consistent word order make interpretation more direct, with less guesswork about idioms.

## 12. Why Synthese Helps Human-AI Communication

1. **Reduced Ambiguity:**  
   Clear markers for tense, intent, certainty, and references minimize misunderstandings.

2. **Machine Parsing:**  
   Strict word order and tags (@doc001, #1) allow an AI to quickly map each sentence component.

3. **Human Learnability:**  
   Simple phonetics and grammar rules make it more accessible than traditional programming languages.

4. **Scalability:**  
   Additional markers (e.g., politeness, domain-specific tags) can be added without breaking the core syntax.

## Conclusion

Synthese is a **conceptual language** that bridges the gap between the **fluidity of human speech** and the **structured nature of AI parsing**. By combining:

- **Simple phonetics**  
- **Rigid syntactic rules**  
- **Clear tagging** for intent and references  
- **A robust morphological system**  

Synthese **minimizes confusion** and **facilitates a direct, efficient communication channel** between humans and digital intelligences.
