## **How Synthese Improves Clarity**

1. **Rigid Word Order (S-V-O):**  
   Each sentence follows a consistent structure:  
   \- **Marker** (e.g., *di*, *qi*) + **Subject** + **Tense** + **Verb** + **Object** + **Modifiers**.  
   This reduces ambiguity, so both humans and AIs know where to find the subject, verb, and object.

2. **Clear Tense & Aspect:**  
   Using *ya*, *ha*, or *ma* removes confusion about when an action occurs. No irregular verbs or hidden tense markers—everything is explicit.

3. **Descriptor Marker (le-):**  
   By prefixing descriptors with *le-*, it’s always apparent which word is being modified. In English, adjectives or adverbs can be ambiguous (e.g., “light suit” vs. “suit light”).

4. **Speech-Act & Certainty Markers:**  
   - *di, qi, ci* immediately clarify whether it’s a statement, question, or command.  
   - The *#1, #0* system indicates the speaker’s level of certainty, which can help an AI assess how definitive the user’s statement is.

5. **Reference Tags (@):**  
   - *@birdsong, @doc123* are explicit pointers. They give the AI a direct link to external data or context without guesswork.  

6. **Minimal Ambiguity:**  
   - No complicated or irregular grammatical forms.  
   - Each sentence part has a clear function, reducing misunderstandings.

Overall, **Synthese** creates an environment where humans can easily learn the rules and AIs can parse them with high accuracy. By balancing *simplicity* (for human use) and *explicit tagging* (for machine parsing), this language aims to streamline dialog in a way standard languages often can’t achieve.
